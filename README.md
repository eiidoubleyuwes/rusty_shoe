Hello there,here is where my rust code is,I decided to learn Rust over the holidays as a fun challenge.

I'm about to speak Rust as a second language especially because of how simple it is to understand.

My deliverables are as follows:

A repository I am using to push my Rust code

The plan is to do 20 days of Rust with like a project each week if I can after words*

*meaning after all has been spoken

I build the project using cargo build and run with cargo run although some files I have had to use rustc


Map:


The class files are in the format : day {x} files,

The simple project files are in the format : day {x}_{xxxxx}
